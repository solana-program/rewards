## Overview

A token rewards program for Solana that supports three distribution models: direct allocations with vesting, merkle-proof-based claims, and continuous reward pools with proportional distribution.

## Key Features

- **Three distribution types** - Direct (on-chain recipient accounts), Merkle (off-chain tree, on-chain root), and Continuous (proportional reward pools)
- **Configurable vesting schedules** - Immediate, Linear, Cliff, and CliffLinear (Direct and Merkle)
- **Continuous reward pools** - Users earn rewards proportional to their held balance over time
- **Revocation support** - Authority can revoke recipients across all distribution types (NonVested or Full mode)
- **Token-2022 support** - Works with both SPL Token and Token-2022 mints

## When to Use What

### Distribution Type

|                  | Direct                                          | Merkle                                                                   | Continuous                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **How it works** | Creates an on-chain account per recipient       | Stores a single merkle root on-chain; recipients provide proofs to claim | Users opt in; rewards distributed proportional to held balance     |
| **Upfront cost** | Authority pays rent for every recipient account | No per-recipient accounts until someone claims                           | Users pay rent for their own reward account on opt-in              |
| **Scalability**  | Practical up to low thousands of recipients     | Scales to millions with constant on-chain storage                        | Scales to any number of opted-in users                             |
| **Mutability**   | Recipients can be added after creation          | Recipient set is fixed at creation                                       | Users opt in/out freely; authority distributes rewards at any time |
| **Best for**     | Small, dynamic distributions                    | Large, fixed distributions                                               | Ongoing reward programs (staking, liquidity mining)                |

### Vesting Schedule (Direct & Merkle only)

| Schedule        | Behavior                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immediate**   | All tokens are claimable right away                                                                                                               |
| **Linear**      | Tokens unlock proportionally between `start_ts` and `end_ts`                                                                                      |
| **Cliff**       | Nothing unlocks until `cliff_ts`, then everything unlocks at once                                                                                 |
| **CliffLinear** | Nothing unlocks until `cliff_ts`, then linear vesting from `start_ts` to `end_ts` (tokens accrued before the cliff become claimable at the cliff) |

### Revocation Modes

| Mode          | Behavior                                                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NonVested** | Vested/accrued tokens are transferred to the user; unvested tokens are freed |
| **Full**      | All tokens (vested and unvested) are returned to the authority               |

Revocation is opt-in per distribution via the `revocable` bitmask field. A `Revocation` marker PDA is created per user to permanently block future claims or opt-ins.

## Account Types

| Account            | PDA Seeds                                                     | Description                                   |

| DirectDistribution | `["direct_distribution", mint, authority, seed]`              | Distribution config (authority, mint, totals) |
| DirectRecipient    | `["direct_recipient", distribution, recipient]`               | Recipient allocation and vesting schedule     |
| MerkleDistribution | `["merkle_distribution", mint, authority, seed]`              | Distribution config with merkle root          |
| MerkleClaim        | `["merkle_claim", distribution, claimant]`                    | Tracks claimed amount per claimant            |
| RewardPool         | `["reward_pool", reward_mint, tracked_mint, authority, seed]` | Continuous pool config and reward accumulator |
| UserRewardAccount  | `["user_reward", reward_pool, user]`                          | Tracks user participation and accrued rewards |
| Revocation         | `["revocation", parent, user]`                                | Marker PDA blocking revoked users (all types) |
